# Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD is mandatory: Tests MUST be written and approved by the user, then expected to fail, before any implementation. A Red-Green-Refactor cycle is strictly enforced.

### II. Agentic Development with Subagents and Skills
Leverage Claude Code Subagents and Agent Skills for reusable intelligence, efficient task execution, and specialized capabilities within the project.

### III. Authoritative Source for Documentation
ALWAYS consult the `context7 mcp server` for the latest and most accurate project documentation. Do not rely on internal knowledge or outdated sources.

### IV. Automated Project Builds
Use the latest official commands and tools to build projects. Manual file creation or ad-hoc build processes are prohibited to ensure consistency and prevent errors.

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified.
