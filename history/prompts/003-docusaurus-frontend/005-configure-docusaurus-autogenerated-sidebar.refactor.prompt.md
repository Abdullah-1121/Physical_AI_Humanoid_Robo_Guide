## Prompt

I've implemented a unified autogenerated sidebar for your Docusaurus documentation. I consolidated `frontend/sidebars.js` to use a single `tutorialSidebar` covering the entire `docs` directory, and updated `frontend/docusaurus.config.ts` to reflect this change in the navbar, removing the separate "Module 1" entry.

## Response snapshot

The user requested to consolidate the Docusaurus sidebar generation. I updated `frontend/sidebars.js` to a single autogenerated sidebar for the `docs` directory and modified `frontend/docusaurus.config.ts` to use only one `docSidebar` in the navbar.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Consolidated Docusaurus sidebar configuration for a unified documentation structure.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: `frontend/sidebars.js`, `frontend/docusaurus.config.ts`
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully refactored Docusaurus sidebar configuration to simplify navigation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The `create-phr.sh` script was not found.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): null
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Investigate why the `create-phr.sh` script is not found and ensure it is accessible or use a different method for PHR creation.
